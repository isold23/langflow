# Global Variables

Global Variables are a really useful feature of Langflow.
They allow you to define reusable variables that can be accessed from any Text field in your project.

The first thing you need to do is find a **Text field** in a Component, so let's talk about what a Text field is.

## Text Fields

Text fields are the fields in a Component where you can write text but that does not allow you to open a Text Area.

The easiest way to find fields that are Text fields, though, is to look for fields that have a üåê button.

  }}
  style={{ width: "50%" }}
/>

## Creating a Global Variable

To create a Global Variable, you need to click on the üåê button in a Text field and that will open a dropdown showing your currently available variables and at the end of it **+ Add New Variable**.

  sources={{
    light: "img/add-new-variable.png",
    dark: "img/add-new-variable.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "60%" }}
/>

Click on **+ Add New Variable** and a window will open where you can define your new Global Variable.

In it, you can define the **Name** of the variable, the optional **Type** of the variable, and the **Value** of the variable.

The **Name** is the name that you will use to refer to the variable in your Text fields.

The **Type** is optional for now but will be used in the future to allow for more advanced features.

The **Value** is the value that the variable will have.

    light: "img/create-variable-window.png",
    dark: "img/create-variable-window.png",
  }}
  style={{ width: "60%" }}
/>

After you have defined your variable, click on **Save Variable** and your variable will be created.

After that, once you click on the üåê button in a Text field, you will see your new variable in the dropdown.
